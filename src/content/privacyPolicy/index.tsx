          We collect Personal Information by asking you questions about yourself
          as an employee, service repair person, or contractor, as well as your
          contact information. We will use this information to create your Grash
          profile (“Grash Profile”). You may also provide us with Personal
          Information through any website mobile application provided to you by
          Grash. In addition to this information, we also collect certain
          Personal Information for administration of the Grash Service,
          including account credentials and payment information, although please
          note that payment card information is stored and maintained by our

          While you use the Grash Service, we automatically record information
          that your browser sends whenever you visit our website or mobile
          software application. For example, we may receive: the name of the
          domain and host from which you access the Internet, the Internet
          Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using, the date and time
          you access our Service, and certain device information (e.g., type of
          device, operating system). We use this information to measure the
          usage of our Service, to understand how to serve you better, and to
          assist with our analytics, security, and error handling. For more
          information about the technology we use as part of this automatic
          collection of personal information, please see our Cookie Policy. Most
          web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
          include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to
          signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
          browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology
          standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
          finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals
          or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not
          to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
          that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
          practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.{' '}

          technological, and procedural measures, to help to safeguard your
          Personal Information and to prevent unauthorized access and
          disclosure. In addition, we use industry-standard technology, such as

          sensitive Personal Information, designed to prevent unauthorized
          persons from gaining access to your Personal Information and Grash
